# second_number = input("Please enter another number")
# print(f"The total is {int(first_number) + int(second_number)}")

# Q2 Write a program that takes two numbers from the user,and outputs the equation representing the multiplication ofthe two numbers
# first_number = input("Please enter a number")
# second_number = input("Please enter another number")
# print(f"The total is {int(first_number) * int(second_number)}")

# Q3 Write a program that takes a distance in kilometers from the user, and output the distance in meters and centimeters.
# distance_kms = input("Please enter a distance in kms")
# print(f"{distance_kms}km = {int(distance_kms) * 1000}m")
# print(f"{distance_kms}km = {int(distance_kms) * 10000}cm")

# Q4 Write a program that takes the user's name and height(in centimeters), and outputs a summary sentence
# first_name = input("What is your name?")
# height = input("What is your height in cms?")
