# Function - an activity that is natural to the purpose of a person or thing.
# i.e. an application can be used to store data or send us notifications. Tasks that it performs. Things it can do.

# Functions we have already seen
# input(), len(), int(), print()

# name = input("What is your name?")
# age = input("How old are you?")
# if age >= 18:
#     print("Welcome")
# else:
#     print("You can not enter")

# # Task Separation

# # 'def' defines a function so that we can call on it again later and use it without writing a whole lot of code over and over again.

# def ask_user_name():
#     name = input("What is your name?")
#     # print(name)
#     return name




# def as_user_age():
#     age = input("How old are you?")
#     if age >= 18:
#         print("Welcome")
#     else:
#         print("You can not enter")




# Function definition
# Calling a function

# Parameters
# note - if you call a variable within a Function, it will not exist outside of the function.

# def add(number1, number2):
#     result = number1 + number2
#     print(result)

# # the below, assigns the numbers to the variables 'number1' and 'number2'
# add(2,3)
