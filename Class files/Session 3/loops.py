# letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# print(letters[0])
# print(letters[1])
# print(letters[2])
# when you want to print something multiple times, loops are very handy.

# While Loops
# the loop will get execute as long as the condition is true.
# count = 0
# while 5 > count:
#     print("Hello")
#     count = count + 1

# name = (input("What is your name?"))
# while name != "Ashley":
#     print("I don't know you")
#     name = input("Well, what's the new name?")

# For Loops

# letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# for letter in letters:
#     print(letter)

# Below explanation: do whatever is indented, ten times.
# handy way to do something ten times. 0 is inclusive, 10 is exclusive.. so this would be 0 to 9.
# list_name[0:10]
# for number in range(0,10):
#     print(number)

# Nested Loops
# students = [
#             ["Cindy", "Emily", "Eve"],
#             ["Julie", "Maddy", "Andrea"],
#             ["Jenny", "Sarah", "Yara"]
#             ]
# for student in students:
#     print(student)
#     for name in student:
#         print(name)

# count = 0
# while 5 > count:
#     print(f"Hello, the number is {count}")
#     count += 1
